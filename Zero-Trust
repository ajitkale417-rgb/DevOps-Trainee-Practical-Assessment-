What “Zero-Trust” Means Here

A zero-trust KubeArmor policy means:

Deny everything by default

Explicitly allow only what the application needs

Log violations when anything else is attempted

For Wisecow (a simple web app), we typically:

Allow read access to required system files

Allow network access on port 80/443

Block shell execution, package managers, and sensitive paths
